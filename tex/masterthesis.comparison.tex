\subsubsection{Preliminary Upper Bounds on Performance -- The STREAM Benchmark}

Scientific applications that solve partial differential equations rely on sparse matrix computations, which usually exhibit the sustainable memory bandwidth as bottleneck with respect to the runtime performance of the program \cite{hager11}. The purpose of this section is to establish a frame in terms of an upper bound on performance in which the efficiency developed solver framework can be evaluated critically. As common measure for the maximum sustainable bandwidth, low-level benchmarks can be used, which focus on evaluating specific properties of the hardware architecture to be used. In this case the STREAM benchmark suite provides apt tests, which are designed to work with data sets that exceed the cache size of the involved processor architecture. This forces the processors to stream the needed data directly from the memory instead of reusing the data residing in their caches. These types of tests can be used to calculate an upper bound on the memory bandwidht.

In terms of parallel scalability, the STREAM benchmark can also be used as an upper performance bound. According to \cite{petsc-web-page} the parallel performance of memory bandwidth limited codes correlates with the parallel performance of the STREAM benchmark, i.e. a scalable increase in memory bandwidth is necessary for scalable application performance. The intermediate results of the benchmark can then be used to test different configurations that bind hardware resources to the involved processes. Before presenting results the different binding configurations will be explained.

The first configuration sequentially binds the processes to the cores beginning on the first socket. When every core has a bound process the binding algorithm binds the following processes to cores of the second socket. The second configuration binds the processes in a round robin manner regarding the sockets. The this configuration in difference to the second configuration binds one process to three cores. Figure REFERENCE demonstrates the different binding options for two sockets and processors with twelve cores when 8 processes are to be bound to the resources.
