\chapter{Finite-Volume Methods for Incompressible Flows -- Theoretical Basics}
\label{sec:fvm}

This chapter deals with the fundamentals of the numerical solution via a finite-volume method for the formerly presented set of partial differential equations (\ref{eq:completeset}). The focus of this chapter is providing an overview of the methods used in the present thesis. The information contained in this chapter is based on \cite{ferziger02,jasak96,schaefer99,muzaferja}. The overview starts by mentioning the relevant grid types and the discretization techniques. On the basis of integral formulations of the equations to be solved, the contained integrals and differential operators have to be discretized. This chapter furthermore presents different approaches to the handling of corrections for cases of increased non-orthogonality which are causing degradation of grid quality.
  
The finite-volume method aims at providing particular linear algebraic equations to determine an approximate solution of a partial differential equation. However, since the Navier-Stokes equations are nonlinear, an intermediate step is necessary before linear systems can be derived and solvers for linear equation systems can be applied: The discrete equations have to be linearized. This condition leads to the need for an iteration process, the \emph{Picard iteration}, which this thesis will also briefly explain. 
      
\section{Numerical Grid}

This section provides a brief overview of the grid structure relevant to the present thesis. One central idea behind finite-volume methods is to solve partial differential equations by integrating them over the specified continuous problem domain and dividing this domain into a finite number of subdomains, the so-called \emph{control volumes}. The result of this finite partition of a contiguous problem domain is called numerical grid. Every grid consists of a finite number of control volumes representing the boundaries of a discrete domain of integration. Depending on whether the numerical solution of an equation is to be calculated on the boundary vertices or in the center of a grid cell, the variable arrangement is denoted to be vertex-oriented or cell center-oriented. The remainder of the present thesis assumes that the variables reside in the cell centers of the respective control volumes.

Another option to arrange variables specifically for algorithms that solve the Navier-Stokes equations is the so-called \emph{staggering}. This method stores the values of different variables at different grid locations. This storage facilitates the interpolation of the respective values. As the methods employed in the present thesis are intended to be applicable to complex geometries, the cell-centered non-staggered approach offers more flexibility. Figure \ref{fig:cellvertex} shows the different variable arrangement options on a two-dimensional grid.

Regarding the treatment of domain boundaries and the ordering of the cells within the problem domain, different types of numerical grids can be distinguished. The present thesis makes use of so-called boundary-fitted, block-structured grids with hexahedron cells. A structured grid is characterized by a constant amount of grid cells in each coordinate direction. The high regularity of structured grids benefits the computational efficiency of the algorithms to be used on this type of grid. In addition to that, a block-structured grid consists of different grid blocks, of which every single one, considered individually, is structured. Yet, considering the grid as a whole, the grid is unstructured. Figure \ref{fig:blockstruc} shows an example of a block-structured grid with distinguishable grid blocks. The use of block-structured grids is motivated by the need to increase the adaptivity of structured grids while maintaining high computational efficiency. Furthermore, block-structuring embraces the concept of domain decomposition which facilitates the implementation of parallel algorithms for the decomposed computational domain. Boundary-fitted grids represent domain boundaries by means of the geometry of the control volumes residing on those boundaries. This approach may lead to skewed cells and affects the accuracy of the results obtained in these boundary cells. Using local grid refinement techniques to refine the grid in regions of geometrically complex boundaries can alleviate these effects.

Inside a structured grid block, cells with the shape of hexahedrons are used. In addition to the geometric boundaries of each control volume, a numerical grid also provides a mapping that assigns a set of indices of neighboring control volumes \(NB(P):=\{W,S,B,T,N,E\}\) to each control volume with index \(P\).  The indices of the neighboring control volumes are named after the geographic directions. Figure \ref{fig:not} shows a single grid cell with its direct neighbors. The faces \(\{S_w,S_s,S_b,S_t,S_n,S_e\}\) of each hexahedral control volume represent the mentioned geometric boundaries.

\section{Approximation of Integrals and Derivatives}
\label{sec:approxintegralderivative}

In the course of transforming a partial differential equation into a system of linear algebraic equations, integrals and derivatives have to be approximated. The simplest method for approximating an integral is by using the \emph{midpoint rule}. This rule is similar to the mean value theorem of integration, which states that there exists a point \(\vec{\xi} \in V\) for a Riemann integrable function \(\phi\) such that \(\textstyle \phi(\xi) \int_V \mathrm{d}V = \int_V \phi(x) \mathrm{d}V\). For the midpoint rule, \(\vec{\xi}\) is taken to be the center of mass of \(V\). If the integration domain \(V\) is indeed a volume, fortunately the calculation of \(\phi(\mathbb{\xi})\) with \(\textstyle \vec{\xi} := \left({ \int_V x_i \mathrm{d}V }/{ \int_V \mathrm{d}V } \right)_{i = 1,\dots,3}\) presents no difficulties since, due to the collocated variable arrangement, the value of \(\phi\) is stored in the cell center which corresponds to the location \(\vec{\xi}\). However, if the domain of integration is a surface, a preceding interpolation step is necessary.

Furthermore, in order to transform a partial differential equation into a linear algebraic equation, it is necessary to discretize the differential operators of the equations. For numerical reasons, two different discretization techniques are used in this thesis. A common task is discretizing expressions of the form
\begin{displaymath}
  \left(\nabla \phi\right)_e \cdot \vec{n}_e,
\end{displaymath}
where \(\left(\nabla \phi\right)_e\) is the gradient of \(\phi\) on the boundary face \(S_e\). One method is to interpret this expression directly as a directional derivative and approximate it with a central difference
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cds}
  \left(\nabla \phi\right)_e \cdot \vec{n}_e \approx \frac{\phi_P - \phi_E}{|| \vec{x}_P - \vec{x}_E ||_2}.
\end{equation}
Another method would be to first calculate the cell center gradients \(\left(\nabla \phi \right)_P\) and \(\left(\nabla \phi \right)_E\) and interpolate them linearly before calculating the projection onto \(\vec{n}_e\)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:interpolgrad}
  \left(\nabla \phi\right)_e \cdot \vec{n}_e 
  \approx 
  \left[\gamma_e \left(\nabla \phi \right)_P + (1-\gamma_e) \left(\nabla \phi \right)_E \right] \cdot \vec{n}_e,
\end{equation}
where \( \gamma_e := {||\vec{x}_P - \vec{x}_e||_2}/{||\vec{x}_P - \vec{x}_E||_2}\) is a geometric interpolation factor. For calculating the cell center gradients, a method based on Gauss's theorem of integration and the midpoint rule for volume integration is employed
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gaussgrad}
  \left( \nabla \phi \right)_{i,P}
  =
  \frac{ \iiint\limits_V \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i}\right) \mathrm{d}V}{\Delta V}
  \approx
  \frac{\sum_f \phi_f n_i S_f}{\Delta V}.
\end{equation}

\section{Treatment of the Non-Orthogonality of Grid Cells}
\label{sec:nonorth}

Unfortunately, real applications involve complex geometries, a fact which in turn affects the grid's orthogonality when using boundary-fitted grids. On non-orthogonal meshes, the directional derivative in the direction of the face's unit normal vector \(\vec{n}_e\) can no longer be approximated as in (\ref{eq:cds}). On the other hand, the exclusive usage of (\ref{eq:gaussgrad}) is not desirable due to the bigger truncation error following from this approximation \cite{jasak96}. Hence, a compromise is made and the surface vector \(\vec{S}_e := S_e \vec{n}_e\) is decomposed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:orthdecomp}
  \vec{S}_e = \vecg{\Delta} + \vec{k},
\end{equation}
where \(\vecg{\Delta}\) is parallel to the vector \(\vec{d}_e := \left(\vec{x}_E - \vec{x}_P\right)\) that directly connects the center \(\vec{x}_P\) of the control volume \(P\) to the center \(\vec{x}_E\) of its neighbor \(E\). This vector controls the \emph{orthogonal} contribution to the directional derivative. Vector \(\vec{k}\) controls the influence of the \emph{non-orthogonal} contribution. In the next paragraphs, the three main decompositions of the surface vector \(\vec{S}_e\) will be presented by stating the respective expression for \(\vecg{\Delta}\). The resulting vector \(\vec{k}\) can be calculated by using (\ref{eq:orthdecomp}). One important characteristic common to all the presented approaches is that the non-orthogonal contribution vanishes when an orthogonal grid is used. For reasons of graphical representation, the decompositions are chosen to be represented two-dimensionally. Figure \ref{fig:nonorth} gives a geometrical interpretation of the three approaches. The last section deals with the integration of one generic approach into the discretization process. 

The results of a study on the effect of different correctors on the convergence behavior of a solver for partial differential equations can be found in section \ref{sec:studynonorth}.

\subsection{Minimum Correction Approach}

\cite{muzaferja} proposes the \emph{minimum correction approach}. Even though \cite{ferziger02} references \cite{muzaferja}, \cite{ferziger02} uses a different approach, which will be presented in the next paragraph. This method is designed to keep the non-orthogonal contribution minimal by always choosing \(\vec{k}\) to be orthogonal to \(\vecg{\Delta}\), resulting in
\begin{displaymath}
  \vecg{\Delta} = \left( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{S}_e \right) \frac{\vec{d}}{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{d}}.
\end{displaymath}
It is important to note that the influence of the orthogonal contribution decreases with increasing non-orthogonality of the grid.

\subsection{Orthogonal Correction Approach}
\label{seq:orthcorrapproach}

\cite{ferziger02} presents \emph{orthogonal correction approach} for decomposing the surface normal vector. This approach is also implemented in the developed solvers. It uses a simple projection which is independent of the non-orthogonality of the grid. As a result, the orthogonal contribution \(||\vecg{\Delta}||_2 =  ||\vec{S}_e||_2\) and is thus modeled as 
\begin{displaymath}
  \vecg{\Delta} =  || \vec{S}_e ||_2 \frac{\vec{d}}{ ||\vec{d}||_2}.
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{Over-Relaxed Approach}

\cite{jasak96,darwish09} use the \emph{over-relaxed approach} which is characterized by an increasing influence of the orthogonal contribution with increasing grid non-orthogonality, as opposed to the minimum correction approach. The orthogonal contribution is calculated as
\begin{displaymath}
  \vecg{\Delta} =  \left( \vec{S}_e \cdot \vec{S}_e \right) \frac{\vec{d}}{ \vec{d} \cdot \vec{S}_e }.
\end{displaymath}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Deferred Non-Orthogonal Correction}

In order to reduce the computational stencil that would be necessary to handle the non-orthogonal correction implicitly, the correction will be treated explicitly, using a deferred correction which guarantees that in the case of a fully converged solution, only the face normal derivative is taken into account. Generally, the discretization using a non-orthogonal correction would yield 
\begin{displaymath}
  \left( \nabla \phi \right)_e \cdot \vec{S}_e \approx \left(\nabla \phi \right)_e \cdot \vecg{\Delta} + \left( \nabla \phi \right)_e \cdot \vec{k}.
\end{displaymath}
Here, the first term can be approximated using a central differencing scheme for the directional derivative, and the second can be approximated by interpolating cell center gradients. Making use of the fact that this method is applied within a solution algorithm for a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, a deferred correction can be implemented. This correction ensures a smaller error from the non-orthogonality. In the case of the previously mentioned discretization techniques for partial derivatives, a possible deferred correction approach reads
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:decomposenonorth}
  \left( \nabla \phi \right)_e \cdot \vec{S}_e \approx ||\vecg{\Delta}||_2 \frac{\phi_P - \phi_E}{||\vec{x}_P - \vec{x}_E||_2} - \left(\nabla \phi \right)_e^{(n-1)} \cdot \left(\vecg{\Delta} - \vec{S}_e \right).
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq:decomposenonorth}) shows that the use of a deferred correction, in conjunction with the requirement that the non-orthogonal correction vanishes on orthogonal grid, introduces an inconsistent discretization of \( \left(\nabla \phi \right)_e \cdot \vecg{\Delta} \).

\section{Numerical Solution of Nonlinear Systems -- Picard Iteration}
\label{sec:nonlinear}

In the process of solving nonlinear systems, typically two levels of iterations are distinguished: the \emph{inner} iterations which account for the iterations needed to solve a given system of linear equations, and the \emph{outer} iterations which deal with a possible nonlinearity or coupling of the equations. As will be shown in section \ref{sec:segconvective}, outer iterations are also necessary if one chooses the deferred correction approach in order to blend higher and lower order discretization schemes, or, as section \ref{sec:nonorth} showed, in order to apply non-orthogonal correctors.


The system of partial differential equations (\ref{eq:completeset}) is nonlinear due to the terms \(\rho u_i u_j\) which are often denoted as the convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations. It is a standard approach to linearize those terms according to the \emph{Picard-Iteration}. For the convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations or the temperature equation, this means to guess the mass flux \( \rho u_j\) and approximate as
\begin{displaymath}
  \rho u_j u_i \approx \left( \rho u_j \right)^o u_i.
\end{displaymath}
The same procedure applies to the convective terms of the temperature equation \(\rho u_j T\). The advantages of this linearization technique are the low memory requirements and the small computational effort for one iteration. Because of that, this method is commonly implemented in solution programs for flow problems that use a segregated solution algorithm similar to the one utilized in this thesis. However, compared to Newton-like methods, this approach needs more iterations to converge. Another method to linearize convective terms, applicable when using a fully coupled solution algorithm, will be presented in section \ref{sec:nrcoupled}.
